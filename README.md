### Installing TalentScope on Your System

To experience TalentScope's full capabilities firsthand, follow these steps to install and run it on your own system. This guide assumes you have a basic familiarity with Python and its ecosystem.

#### Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Git installed on your system (optional, for cloning the repository).

#### Installation Guide:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - If available, clone the TalentScope repository to your local machine using Git, or download the zip file and extract it.
     ```sh
     git clone https://your-repository-link-here.git TalentScope
     cd TalentScope
     ```
   - If you're downloading a zip file, ensure you extract it to a known directory.

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   - It's best practice to use a Python virtual environment for project dependencies. This keeps your project's libraries separate from your global Python installation.
     ```sh
     # Create a virtual environment
     python -m venv venv
     
     # Activate the virtual environment
     # On Windows
     venv\Scripts\activate
     # On MacOS/Linux
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install all required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run TalentScope**:
   - With all dependencies installed, you can now run the TalentScope application using Streamlit. Execute the following command in your terminal:
     ```sh
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
     Make sure to replace `app.py` with the path to your Streamlit application script if it's named differently.

5. **Access TalentScope**:
   - After running the above command, Streamlit will start the TalentScope application and automatically open it in your default web browser. You can also access the application by navigating to the localhost address displayed in your terminal.
